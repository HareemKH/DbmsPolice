# Police Portal - Criminal Management System

Overview
Welcome to the Crime Management System (CMS), a comprehensive solution designed to streamline police operations and facilitate efficient crime tracking and management. The CMS provides various portals and functionalities for managing police cases, monitoring suspects, handling CCTV footage, and ensuring patrol zones are active and monitored.

This system is divided into multiple modules, each focused on different aspects of crime management. The CMS is designed with both the front-end user experience and the back-end database management in mind to ensure smooth, responsive, and scalable operations.

Key Modules
1. Police Portal
The Police Portal serves as the core of the Crime Management System. It provides access to police officers for tracking and managing criminal cases. Officers can view the case assignments, update case statuses, and monitor real-time data. This portal integrates seamlessly with other modules, offering quick access to cases, suspects, and patrol information.

2. Assigned Cases Portal
The Assigned Cases Portal allows officers and admin staff to assign and track cases efficiently. Officers can receive case assignments, update statuses, and add important details to each case. This portal helps in maintaining a structured flow of case management, from case creation to resolution, ensuring timely updates and transparency.

3. Suspect Portal
The Suspect Portal provides law enforcement with access to detailed profiles of suspects. With the ability to view and manage suspect information, track criminal history, and monitor current criminal activity, this portal helps police officers make informed decisions during investigations.

4. CCTV Footage Portal
The CCTV Footage Portal plays a critical role in real-time surveillance and investigation. Officers can access live footage from CCTV cameras, review recorded footage, and analyze potential criminal activities. Integration with the other portals allows for a seamless transition between suspect monitoring and incident tracking.

5. Overview Dashboard
The Overview Dashboard is a comprehensive control center that consolidates key metrics from all system modules. It provides real-time data on criminal activities, case status updates, and patrol zones. This dashboard helps supervisors and managers make informed decisions by presenting data in a visually appealing and easily digestible format.

6. Alerts System
The Alerts System sends notifications for critical updates, such as high-priority cases, suspect sightings, or urgent patrols needed in certain zones. Alerts can be configured for different levels of priority to ensure that law enforcement is always aware of ongoing situations that require immediate attention.

7. Patrol Zones Portal
The Patrol Zones Portal allows officers to manage and monitor patrol areas. The portal provides an interactive map showing patrol zones, real-time crime data, and active patrol units. Patrol zones are color-coded to indicate priority levels, ensuring officers can focus on high-risk areas and maintain optimal coverage.
