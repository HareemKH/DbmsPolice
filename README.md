# 🚔 Welcome to the Crime Management System! 🚨

Developer’s Note
Hey there! 🎉 Welcome to my very first-ever web project! 🎉 Yup, this is the first big thing I’ve built, and I’m super excited to share it with you. This Crime Management System (CMS) is like a cool superhero team of tech tools for police officers to track crimes, monitor suspects, and patrol areas, all in one place. It's got real-time data, cool maps, and a dashboard that looks sleek and works even smoother. 😎 So, buckle up and dive into the crime-fighting tech of tomorrow! 🕵️‍♂️💻

📚 What’s in the System?
This system is divided into different modules—each serving a very specific purpose to make police work more efficient and less of a hassle. Here’s the lowdown:

1. Police Portal 🕵️‍♀️
This is like the mission control for all officers! 🚨 Here, officers can view case assignments, track updates, and monitor data in real-time. It's the first place to go for all your police-related actions.

2. Assigned Cases Portal 🗃️
Need to assign a case or track one you’ve already got? This portal keeps everything organized, with updates and real-time info on each case. Officers can check progress, update statuses, and add important details.

3. Suspect Portal 🚨
In this portal, law enforcement can dig deep into suspect profiles—criminal history, current activity, and everything in between. It's like an investigation HQ for all the details.

4. CCTV Footage Portal 🎥
Now, this is where things get real-time. Officers can access live footage from cameras, review recordings, and track criminal activity. Think of it as your tech-powered surveillance station.

5. Overview Dashboard 📊
This is where the magic happens! A clean, interactive dashboard that shows you everything at a glance. From crime stats to patrol zones, this dashboard keeps the important info right at your fingertips.

6. Alerts System ⚠️
Get instant notifications for urgent situations like high-priority cases or suspicious activities. Alerts are tailored to make sure nothing slips through the cracks.

7. Patrol Zones Portal 🗺️
With an interactive map, you can see patrol zones, monitor active units, and even check crime data on the fly. You’ll know where to go, where to focus, and what’s happening around you in real-time.
